#  Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm for Malignant Breast Cancer Prediction
Breast cancer remains a global health challenge as the most diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of death among women. In 2022, 2.3 million women worldwide were diagnosed with breast cancer, with 670,000 deaths (WHO, 2024). The delay in diagnosis significantly impacts treatment outcomes. This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm as a solution for early detection of malignant breast cancer. Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of early detection by identifying key factors that influence KNN prediction performance, ultimately improving survival rates through timely diagnosis.
